Welcome to the changelog, in which you will read about all the changes that we make to the project.

<!--truncate-->

For the time being, I haven't documented all the changes that I've made to the project, but since there's already a few of us working on the different parts of the project, I think it's a good idea to start documenting them, especially when there are some breaking changes or the new features being added to the server, that should be implemented in the client SDK as well :)

Stay tuned for the updates and the upcoming features, such as optional message headers!
