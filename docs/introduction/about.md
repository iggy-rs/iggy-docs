**Iggy** is the persistent message streaming platform written in Rust, supporting [QUIC](https://www.chromium.org/quic/), TCP (custom binary specification) and HTTP (regular REST API) transport protocols. Currently, running as a single server, it allows creating streams, topics, partitions and segments, and send/receive messages to/from them. The **messages are stored on disk as an append-only log**, and are persisted between restarts.

The goal of the project is to make a distributed streaming platform (running as a cluster), which will be able to scale horizontally and handle **millions of messages per second**.

### Features

- **Highly performant**, persistent append-only log for the message streaming
- **Very high throughput** for both writes and reads
- **Low latency and predictable resource usage** thanks to the Rust compiled language (no GC)
- **Users authentication and authorization** with granular permissions
- Support for multiple streams, topics and partitions
- Support for **multiple transport protocols** (QUIC, TCP, HTTP)
- Fully operational RESTful API which can be optionally enabled
- Available client SDK in multiple languages
- **Works directly with the binary data** (lack of enforced schema and serialization/deserialization)
- Configurable server features (e.g. caching, segment size, data flush interval, transport protocols etc.)
- Possibility of storing the **consumer offsets** on the server
- Multiple ways of polling the messages:
  - By offset (using the indexes)
  - By timestamp (using the time indexes)
  - First/Last N messages
  - Next N messages for the specific consumer
- Possibility of **auto committing the offset** (e.g. to achieve *at-most-once* delivery)
- **Consumer groups** providing the message ordering and horizontal scaling across the connected clients
- **Message expiry** with auto deletion based on the configurable **retention policy**
- Additional features such as **server side message deduplication**
- **TLS** support for all transport protocols (TCP, QUIC, HTTPS)
- Optional server-side as well as client-side **data encryption** using AES-256-GCM
- Optional metadata support in the form of **message headers**
- Built-in **CLI** to manage the streaming server
- Built-in **benchmarking app** to test the performance
- **Single binary deployment** (no external dependencies)
- Running as a single node (no cluster support yet)

### Supported languages SDK

- [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/iggy)
- [C#](https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-dotnet-client)
- [Go](https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-go-client)
- [Node](https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-node-client)
- [Python](https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-python-client)
- [Java](https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-java-client)

### CLI

The brand new, rich, interactive CLI is being implemented under the `cmd` project, to provide the best developer experience. This will be a great addition to the Web UI, especially for all the developers who prefer using the console tools.

### Web UI

There's an ongoing effort to build the administrative web UI for the server, which will allow to manage the streams, topics, partitions, messages and so on. Check the [Web UI repository](https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-web-ui)

### Docker

You can find the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose` in the root of the repository. To build and start the server, run: `docker compose up`. The official images can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/iggyrs/iggy), simply type `docker pull iggyrs/iggy`.

Additionally, you can run the `client` which is available in the running container, by executing: `docker exec -it iggy-server /client`.
