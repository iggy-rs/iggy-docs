## Iggy docs

The official documentation of [Iggy.rs](https://iggy.rs) being hosted at [docs.iggy.rs](https://docs.iggy.rs).

To start the documentation locally, you need to have [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) installed. If you don't have it yet, you can install it by running:

```bash
npm install -g docusaurus-init
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

After that, you can start the documentation by running:

```bash
npm start
```

To ensure that the documentation can be built, run:

```bash
npm build
```

You can also use npx to run the Docusaurus commands:

```bash
npx docusaurus start
```

```
npx docusaurus build
```

We'll be thankful for helping us keep the documentation up to date, as well, as adding the content to the sections for the other programming languages than Rust! Feel free to contribute to the project by creating a pull request with the changes you've made.
